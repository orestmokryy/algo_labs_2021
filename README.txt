    This is a realisation of Rabin-Carp algorithm

    To input your data change the following
    
    char txt[] = "is this a test and you should panik";
	char pat[] = "is";
		
	int hashing_number = 101; //prime int for hashing
                 //the bigger the number the less colisions you will get, but the computation will get more complex
